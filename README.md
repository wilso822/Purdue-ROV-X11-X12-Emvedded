# Purdue-ROV-X12-Emvedded
Hello and welcome to the repository for the embedded code I created for Purdue ROV's x12 Remora robot. Two different projects were created in HAL, one for the solenoid board that controlled the various tools of the robot via GPIO, the other is for the ESC board that uses PWM to change the speed of the 8 different thrusters on Remora.
